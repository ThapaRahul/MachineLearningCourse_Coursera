# MachineLearningCourse_Coursera

These are the weekly assignments and projects from machine learning course by Professor Andrew Ng. The link to the course is :https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning. 

It is a little old course and it is taught in matlab/octave. However, it is very useful course to learn all the fundamentals of most important machine learning concepts. Also, it gives a very good overview of all the math that is involved in the most basic and important algorithms such as linear regression and logistic regression.
