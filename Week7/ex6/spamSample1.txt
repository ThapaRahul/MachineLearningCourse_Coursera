Hello Rahul: Thank you for reaching out. In the past, we (Villanova) have not permitted students in HSIP to be engaged in outside work (whether a part-time job, coursework, etc.) during their time in the program. The intent is to provide students with an immersive, design experience and outside commitments can interfere.

 

Before we make a decision, can you tell me more about the project you will continue to work on with your faculty mentor? How many hours per week will you need to work on the computer science project?

 

We may be able to make an exception in your case, we just need some more information about time commitments to the research project.

 

Thanks and best, Keith
